 Hydrograph Separation (m3/sec) for each channel
 
 chan_surf:     channel flow contributed from surface runoff
 chan_lat:      channel flow contributed from soil lateral flow
 chan_gwsw:     channel flow contributed from groundwater discharge
 chan_swgw:     channel flow seeped from channel to aquifer
 chan_satexgw:  channel flow contributed from groundwater saturation excess
 chan_satexsw:  channel flow contributed from saturation excess runoff
 chan_tile:     channel flow contributed from tile drain flow
